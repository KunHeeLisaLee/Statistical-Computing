# Statistical Computing (Fall 2024)
Personal repository for coursework from CMU's Statistical Computing course [36-650], taught by Pf. Mikael Kuusela.

# Course Outline
This course provided me with hands-on experience in:
- Command Line Operations (local and remote)
- Python Programming
- Basic Data Structures and Algorithms 
- Code Documentation and Optimization (debuggers and profiling)
- Unit Testing and Error Handling
- Parallel Computing
- AI-Assisted Programming

# Learning Objectives 
1. Use the command line both locally and on remote machines.
2. Develop correct, well-structured and readable code.
3. Design useful unit tests.
4. Effectively use modern software development tools.
5. Select algorithms and data structures to solve common statistical and computing problems.
6. Write programs in Python that are well-designed and facilitate code reuse and generalization.
7. Analyze the computational scaling of programs and use parallelization to speed up runtimes.
